# I'm learning [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
while also practicing a little bit of [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com)

This project has been made using [this tutorial by Fireship on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfaSUYaSgRo), but using SolidJS instead of React.

This is really just looks, there is no events or logic behind it.



## Usage
```bash
# using npm
npm i
npm run dev

# using bun
bun i
bun run dev
```

## Building
```bash
# using npm
npm run build

# using bun
bun run build
```

And it looks like this:
