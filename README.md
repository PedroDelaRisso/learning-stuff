# I'm learning stuff, this is the repository for said stuff

## This is the main README file and serves like an index page, but you can also navigate through the project folders
You can find more information inside each project's folder.
I'm trying to keep this repository as organized as I can.

The projects so far:
- [A Solidjs project](https://github.com/PedroDelaRisso/learning-stuff/tree/main/learning-solid/store-webpage)
- [Another SolidJS project to practice/learn Tailwindcss](https://github.com/PedroDelaRisso/learning-stuff/tree/main/learning-tailwind/discord-inspired-navbar)
